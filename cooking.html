      <h2>About Cooking</h2>
      <img src="bbq.jpg">
      <p>Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption.
        <br>Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.
        <br>Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. Archeological evidence of cooking fires from at least 300,000 years ago exists,
        <br>but some estimate that humans started cooking up to 2 million years ago.
